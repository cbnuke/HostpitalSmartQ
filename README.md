## How to Use

### Clone This repository
Many way to clone such as github WebUI `Clone in Desktop` or `Download ZIP`

### Update any package with Composer
Go to root folder CodeIgniterQuickStart and run this command

```
$ composer update
```

### Success
Now you can develop website by CodeIgniter pattern.
All your code are in folder `application` and static files in `assets`

#### How to use Asset Helper
Asset Helper are available to access static assets in folder `assets`
such as images, css, java script, etc.

```
├── assets/
    └── css/
    └── download/
    └── fonts/
    └── img/
    └── js/
    └── less/
    └── swf/
    └── upload/
    └── xml/
```

And you can call function to use auto style static assets.

~~~
<?=img('test.jpg')?>
<?=css('style.css')?>
<?=less('style.less')?>
<?=js('bootstrap.min.js')?>
...
~~~

Or you can call function to use URL paths.

~~~
<?=img_url()?>test.jpg
<?=css_url()?>style.css
<?=less_url()?>style.less
<?=js_url()?>bootstrap.min.js
...
~~~
